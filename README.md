# Arbitrary_Precision_Calculator-APC
A C implementation of big-number arithmetic, supporting unlimited-precision calculations (memory-bound). Performs +, -, ร, รท on huge integers/floats using custom algorithms. Demonstrates efficient digit storage and memory management. Great for learning low-level number handling in C.
