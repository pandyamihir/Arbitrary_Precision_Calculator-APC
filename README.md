# Arbitrary_Precision_Calculator-APC
- **Development**: Nov 2024 - Nov 2024 
- A C implementation of big-number arithmetic, supporting unlimited-precision calculations (memory-bound). Performs +, -, ร, รท on huge integers/floats using custom algorithms. Demonstrates efficient digit storage and memory management. Great for learning low-level number handling in C.
